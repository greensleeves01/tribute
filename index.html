      <h3 id="headline">Here is a time line of Dr. Sheldrick's life and work:</h3>
      <li><strong>1934</strong> - Born June 4th in Kenya.  The third of four children, raised on a farm filled with domesticated and feral animals.</li>
      <li><strong>1950</strong> - Matriculated with Honors from Kenya High School and the possibility of a scholarship to attend university, but instead, opted for marriage.</li>
      <li><strong>1955-1976</strong> - Co-warden of Tsavo National Park with her late husband, David Sheldrick.  Raised and rehabilitated back into the wild community orphans of misfortune from many different wild species, including elephants, black rhinos, buffalo, zebras, elands, kudus, impalas, duikers, reedbuck, dikdiks, warthogs, civets, mongooses and birds. She was a recognized authority on the rearing of wild creatures and was the first person to perfect milk formula and necessary husbandry for both infant milk-dependent elephants and rhinos.</li>
      <li><strong>1977</strong> - After her husband's death, created the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in Nairobi, Kenya. Embracing the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife in Kenya, the DSWT today operates the most successful orphan-elephant rescue & rehab program in the world alongside Anti-Poaching Teams, Mobile Veterinary Units and Aerial Surveillance and a Sky Vet initiative in partnership with the Kenya Wildlife Service.  Other projects with an aim to safeguard the natural environment and enhance community awareness include Saving Habitats and Commmunity Outreach.</li>
      <li><strong>1989</strong> - For her work in conservation, Daphne was bequeathed an MBE (Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) by Queen Elizabeth II during the Queen's Birthday Honors.</li>
      <li><strong>1992</strong> - Elevated to UNEP's Global 500 Roll of Honor, where she was among the first 500 people worldwide to have been accorded the honor.</li>
      <li><strong>2000</strong> - Awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine and Surgery by Glasgow University in June.</li>
      <li><strong>2001</strong> -Honored in December by the Kenyan Government through the prestigious Moran of the Order of the Burning Spear (MBS) decoration. </li>
      <li><strong>2002</strong> - The BBC recognized Daphne with its Lifetime Achievement Award.</li>
      <li><strong>2005</strong> - In the November issue of <i>Smithsonian</i> magazine, Daphne was named as one of 35 people, worldwide, who have made a difference in terms of animal husbandry and wildlife conservation.</li>
      <li><strong>2006</strong> - Queen Elizabeth II promoted Daphne to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year's Honors List for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya, the first damehood to be awarded in Kenya since the country received independence in 1963.</li>
      <li><strong>2011</strong> - Daphne appeared as herself in the documentary, <a href="http://bit.ly/2zzQOeF"> Born to Be Wild</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>2014</strong> - Of all her accomplishments, Daphne said she was most proud of Tsavo National Park, and its influence on her family. The 5,000 square miles of federally protected land that she helped to establish was a direct response to the devastation of wildlife caused by poachers.  
    <li><strong>2017</strong> - Daphne remained a vocal opponent of poaching in recent years, warning that without increased funding for protection and preservation, elephants could be extinct in less than 15 years. A 2017 report by <i>The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</i> found while elephant poaching has gradually declined, Eastern Africa has lost about half of its elephant population in the past decade. 
      
Her admiration for the animals seemed to grow even as their numbers fell. In the acknowledgments section of her memoir, she thanked “the elephants themselves, who by example have demonstrated how to cope with adversity. . . .They, who have suffered so much at the hands of humans, never lose the ability to forgive, even though, being elephants, they will never be able to forget.”</li>
            <li><strong>2018</strong> - Dies at the age of 83 on April 12th from breast cancer. Daphne leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, a family of now, wild, living orphaned elephants, and a lasting legacy for wildlife conservation.  Daphne gave her life to conservation and her knowledge and wisdom live on through the charity she founded.
              
As in elephant society, the mantle of matriarch has been passed to her daughter Angela, who has run the DSWT for 17 years, supported by her husband Robert Carr-Hartley, and sons Taru and Roan. They will continue Daphne’s legacy, much as Daphne had built on David’s legacy when she founded the DSWT. For elephants, family is everything, and in the Sheldricks, elephants have a family that will stand beside them to face their challenges with them, as equals, and thanks to a compassionate and caring global public, with the ability to develop programs that conserve and protect the species and all those species reliant on them.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“Daphne’s legacy is immeasurable and her passing will reverberate far and wide, because the difference she has made for conservation in Kenya is unparalleled. She will be sorely missed, but never forgotten, and this is what Daphne drew the most comfort from in her final weeks, knowing that her memory and work would continue with the tiny steps of baby elephants for generations to come, and that the work that she pioneered has been able to achieve so much for wildlife and wild places throughout Kenya.” </p>
      <div>-- Angela Sheldrick, CEO of the DSWT and daughter of Daphne Sheldrick.</div>
